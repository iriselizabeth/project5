        <p class="info info-1">Maya Tihtiyas Attean (born 1994) is a Wabanaki artist living and working in Portland. She
            grew up on Alnabe
            Menahan, the Penobscot Nation Reservation. Her work has evolved into using photography to create art
            reflecting
            her ancestry, resiliency, and culture. Her experience growing up on a reservation and then migrating to a
            city
            has given her a unique perspective upon two worlds that she merges by marrying the techniques of multiple
            cultures in her work. She earned her BFA with honors in photography in May 2023 from the Maine College of
            Art
            and Design. She is currently one of the 2024 BIPOC artist studio awardees at SPACE gallery in Portland.</p>

    <h2>Mikwidahamin / Portal</h2>

        <p class="info info-2">Colonialism and capitalism value objectification, commodification, and control over all.
            The
            colonists began by
            dispossessing and disconnecting Indigenous people from the land, collecting our bodies and artifacts along
            the
            way, now they are focused on collecting our stories. Since we are considered to be a disappearing people,
            there
            is a desperation to collect what is left, what is rare.</p>

    <div class="image-container image-container3">
        <img src="img/portal2.jpg" alt="Portal">

        <p>Mikwidahamin / Portal is inspired by a fishing weir that was built many years ago in Sipayik with pieces that
            still stand today. The double curved design opening to the west for the fish to swim into during sunrise is
            a
            perfect example of Wabanaki relationship with the natural world. This weir has always made me think of my
            grandfather who I never got a chance to meet. His hands worked on fishing weirs, baskets, and wreaths his
            entire
            life. I have photographs of him standing in the same spot, where a newer weir is today.</p>

        <p>This installation serves as a portal to a different realm of imagining. Can we look at these objects through
            the
            natural world? Can we look at them through the hands that created them, depended on them, cherished them?
            Can we
            create new Indigenous futures in which we thrive, connected to our ancestors past and present, without
            colonial
            constraints?</p>

        <p>I create art from the earth, stories, and ways of knowing given by my Wabanaki ancestors for my future
            descendants. Our invisible threads of genetic memory connect our people together through time and
            space.<br><br>
