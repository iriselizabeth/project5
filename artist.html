            <p class="info info-1">Maya Tihtiyas Attean (born 1994) is a Wabanaki artist living and working in Portland.
                She
                grew up on Alnabe
                Menahan, the Penobscot Nation Reservation. Her work has evolved into using photography to create art
                reflecting
                her ancestry, resiliency, and culture. Her experience growing up on a reservation and then migrating to
                a
                city
                has given her a unique perspective upon two worlds that she merges by marrying the techniques of
                multiple
                cultures in her work. She earned her BFA with honors in photography in May 2023 from the Maine College
                of
                Art
                and Design. She is currently one of the 2024 BIPOC artist studio awardees at SPACE gallery in Portland.

            <p class="info info-2">Colonialism and capitalism value objectification, commodification, and control over
                all.
                The
                colonists began by
                dispossessing and disconnecting Indigenous people from the land, collecting our bodies and artifacts
                along
                the
                way, now they are focused on collecting our stories. Since we are considered to be a disappearing
                people,
                there
                is a desperation to collect what is left, what is rare.</p>

        <p>Mikwidahamin / Portal is inspired by a fishing weir that was built many years ago in Sipayik with pieces
            that
            still stand today. The double curved design opening to the west for the fish to swim into during sunrise
            is
            a
            perfect example of Wabanaki relationship with the natural world. This weir has always made me think of
            my
            grandfather who I never got a chance to meet. His hands worked on fishing weirs, baskets, and wreaths
            his
            entire
            life. I have photographs of him standing in the same spot, where a newer weir is today.</p>

        <p>I create art from the earth, stories, and ways of knowing given by my Wabanaki ancestors for my future
            descendants. Our invisible threads of genetic memory connect our people together through time and
            space.<br><br>
