            Indigeneity, access, and ownership; and examples of artists and community groups telling stories
            and
            imbuing power to objects on their own terms.  </p>

        <p class="info">While many institutions are doing work to confront the complicated provenance within their
            collections,
            Objects and Power features contemporary artists who consider these problems in their work—either
            directly or by circumvention. Be it through unpacking and critiquing power structures or through
            material directly carrying power in resistance, Objects and Power connects the dots between the objects
            we care about and the “work” these objects are doing.</p><br><br>
